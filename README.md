# Porject Title : Face Recognition using MTCNN and FaceNet

1. Problem Statement-
    To identify or verify individuals based on their facial features captured in images.

2. Sources:
   (a) Date:    5th April 2024. (Project Date)

3. Dataset-

    data that can be downloaded at:

Understanding the dataset:
It is a small dataset for experimenting with computer vision techniques. It has a training directory containing 14-20 photos each of the celebrities

*Ben Afflek
*Elton John
*Jerry Seinfeld
*Madonna
*Mindy Kaling
The validation directory has 5 photos of each celebrity.


4. Techniques and Algorithms used -

     1.In this project Implemented Techniques Like MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) and FaceNet,Employing MTCNN, the system will accurately detect faces within input images, even under challenging conditions like variations in pose and lighting.
